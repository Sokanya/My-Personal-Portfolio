      <h2>Hi, I am Sokanya ðŸ‘‹</h2>
      <p>
        I am the second born in a family of four, raised in Mthatha â€” a vibrant town in the Eastern Cape.
        Surrounded by extroverted siblings, I have always been the quiet observer, 
        but my heart speaks loudly through my goals and achievements.

      <p>
        Growing up with my grandmother and mother, I learned values of love, resilience, and faith.
        My familyâ€™s belief in Christianity shapes how we live and spread kindness daily.
